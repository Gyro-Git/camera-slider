camera_slider.ino is the regular software with manual and automatic mode while Experimental_version.ino is an experimental version of my code for the slider. This is also the code I want to explain a bit. I assume you saw the video about the slider (https://youtu.be/EXuQKe590TM). if not then I'd suggest watching the part about this code (8:50). Apart from that there is couple of things you should understand before delving into the code.

1. Stepper motor: As the name suggest stepper motor is controlled step by step. switching the step pin will cause the motor to move one step which is about 1/200th on a revolution. numberOfSteps variable sets how many steps it takes from one end to another. When talking about speed we are talking about times between individual steps. To put it in perspective the fastest delay physically possible on my slider is 75us. my slider is 31 000 steps long at 75us per step is takes about 2.325 seconds to go from one end to another. Except the makeStep function actually uses the delay twice so its actually 2.325s*2 = 4.75s

2. OLED implementation: Since the graphs are drawn on the display, we have to take it in to consideration. The resolution is 128x64 pixels. When the graph is drawn the points are then translated to the same grid but scaled to the size of the slider. so the 128 horizontal pixels are scaled to 31 000. The Y axis is what I can't figure out

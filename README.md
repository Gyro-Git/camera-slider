This is a experimental version of my code for my motorized camera slider. I assume you saw the video about the slider (https://youtu.be/EXuQKe590TM). if not then I'd suggest watching the part about this code (8:50). Apart from that there is couple of things you should understand before delving into the code.

1. Stepper motor: As the name suggest stepper motor is controlled step by step. switching the step pin will cause the motor to move one step which is about 1/200th on a revolution.
